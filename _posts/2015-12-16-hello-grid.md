I remember reading about The Grid which was described as the first artificial  intelligence (AI) platform that creates websites. I had flashbacks of childhood dreams of building robots and their brains. How would a robot brain work, what is a brain, what is thinking? The whole trail of ideas from robots to their brains is what got me into computers and information technology.

I could not wait to try out this new platform to see what it could do and what I could do with it. So I became a founding member in November, 2014\. I was expecting its arrival earlier this year which was slated for Spring 2015\. Alas that milestone came and went for me but that's was OK, they were working out the bugs and kinks of this AI baby.

How much closer are we to the technological singularity? It certainly feels like a step closer but only time will tell. Still, I find it very exciting and I'm eager to push the technological boundaries of content creation.

I know you want to join the evolution - [thegrid.io/\#8406 ][0]
